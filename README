This script will allow you to command pool configurations on multiple miners from one simple prompt. It complements the cgminer bundled 'miner.php' nicely for people that run larger mining operations. It provides the following features using an object oriented miner approach:

- Stores previously used pools in a database stored in the current working directory. This allows the user to reuse pool settings with ease regardless of worker reboots or saved cgminer configs.
	
	The database stores:
  	- Pool URL
  	- Worker username prefix
  	- Worker type (username based or payment address based)
  	- Pool priority for all pools associated with each coin
  	
- Interfaces with miners running cgminer via JSON API commands over the network
- Allows the user to be selective about which miners to manage

This script has several cgminer api commands built into the miner class. However, only a select few are currently implemented via interactive methods.

- addpool()
- switchpool()

Requirements:

- This script was written for python 3.

- Tested on linux, should work on winblowz but I could be missing something. Let me know if something needs to be fixed.
  
- Cgminer needs to be configured to allow api commands. See cgminer api documentation for more information. Here's an example:

		"api-listen" : true,
		"api-port" : "4028",  
		"api-allow" : "W:<ip of machine script is executed on>",
	   i.e. "api-allow" : "W:192.168.1.2",
		   
- All worker-based usernames must be named as the last octet of the worker's IP address.
  This was the easiest way I could think of labeling/identifying the worker objects.

	i.e. You want to manage these IP's:
		192.168.1.100
		192.168.1.101
		192.168.1.102
			
	 Your workers on the pool must be named:
	 	bob.100
	 	bob.101
	 	bob.102

- Add IP addresses for all workers in the "kows" list. Be mindful of your syntax.

- All workers must use the same password on the pool. Set script variable "workerpw".

- Profit$$


Future plans/feature requests:
- Better error handling and documentation
- Pair down command response status to only 'required' information
- multipharm() - Automatically implement all pools for a particular coin based on priority
- Command line arg support for multipharm()
- Additional features to include stat monitoring, rebooting, alerting, etc
